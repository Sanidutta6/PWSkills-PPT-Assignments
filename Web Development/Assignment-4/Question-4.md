ECMAScript 6, also known as ES6 or ES2015, introduced several major features and enhancements to the JavaScript language. Here are some of the key features introduced in ECMAScript 6:

1. **Block-Scoped Declarations:**
   - The introduction of `let` and `const` keywords allows for block-level scoping of variables, providing an alternative to the function scope of `var`.

2. **Arrow Functions:**
   - Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions.
   - They use a fat arrow (`=>`) and have a shorter syntax compared to regular function expressions.
   - Arrow functions also have lexical scoping of `this`, meaning they inherit the `this` value from their surrounding context.

3. **Classes:**
   - The introduction of the `class` keyword allows for more straightforward creation of objects using a class-based syntax.
   - Classes provide a more traditional object-oriented programming approach, including the use of constructors, inheritance, and class methods.

4. **Enhanced Object Literals:**
   - Object literals (key-value pairs) were enhanced with new syntax and capabilities.
   - Property shorthand allows concise assignment of variables as object properties.
   - Object method shorthand allows defining methods within object literals using a shorter syntax.
   - Computed property names enable dynamic property names using expressions.

5. **Default Parameters:**
   - Default parameter values can now be assigned directly in function declarations.
   - Default parameters are used when no argument is provided or when an argument is explicitly passed as `undefined`.

6. **Template Literals:**
   - Template literals introduce a new way to define strings using backticks (\` \`) instead of single or double quotes.
   - Template literals support multiline strings and allow for the interpolation of variables and expressions using `${}`.

7. **Destructuring Assignment:**
   - Destructuring assignment provides an efficient way to extract values from arrays or objects into separate variables using a concise syntax.
   - It simplifies working with complex data structures by easily extracting specific values.

8. **Spread Syntax:**
   - The spread syntax (`...`) allows for the expansion of arrays or objects in places where multiple elements or key-value pairs are expected.
   - It can be used to combine arrays, clone objects, or pass multiple arguments to functions.

9. **Modules:**
   - ECMAScript 6 introduced native support for modules, allowing developers to organize and share code across different files and projects.
   - Modules provide a clean and standardized way to define exports and imports, enabling better code organization and reusability.

These are just a few of the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6. ES6 brought significant improvements to the JavaScript language, enhancing its readability, maintainability, and functionality. Subsequent ECMAScript versions have continued to build upon these foundations, introducing additional features and enhancements to the language.
