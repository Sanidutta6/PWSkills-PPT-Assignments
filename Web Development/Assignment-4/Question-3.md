The main differences between `var` and `let` in JavaScript are related to scoping, hoisting, and redeclaration. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

**Scoping:**
- Variables declared with `var` have function scope or global scope, meaning they are accessible throughout the entire function or global environment.
- Variables declared with `let` have block scope, meaning they are limited to the block (enclosed within curly braces) where they are defined, such as within an if statement, loop, or function.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  function example() {
    if (true) {
      var varVariable = "Hello";
      let letVariable = "World";
    }
    console.log(varVariable); // "Hello"
    console.log(letVariable); // ReferenceError: letVariable is not defined
  }
  example();
  ```

**Hoisting:**
- Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope, which means they can be accessed before their declaration. However, their initial value is `undefined` until the assignment.
- Variables declared with `let` are also hoisted to the top of their scope, but they remain in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until their declaration is reached in the code.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  console.log(varVariable); // undefined
  var varVariable = 10;
  
  console.log(letVariable); // ReferenceError: letVariable is not defined
  let letVariable = 20;
  ```

**Redeclaration:**
- Variables declared with `var` can be redeclared within the same scope without any error. This can lead to potential bugs and unintended overwriting of variables.
- Variables declared with `let` cannot be redeclared within the same scope. Attempting to redeclare a `let` variable will result in a syntax error.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  var varVariable = 10;
  var varVariable = 20; // No error, value overwritten
  
  let letVariable = 10;
  let letVariable = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'letVariable' has already been declared
  ```
