In HTML, there is a distinction between tags and elements. Here's a brief explanation of the difference between the two:

1. **HTML Tags:** HTML tags are the building blocks of HTML documents. They are used to define the structure and semantics of the content within an HTML document. Tags are written as opening and closing pairs, enclosed in angle brackets (`<>`). For example, `<p>`, `<div>`, and `<img>` are all HTML tags. Tags define the purpose and type of the element they surround.

2. **HTML Elements:** HTML elements are made up of HTML tags, along with the content they enclose. An element consists of an opening tag, the content, and a closing tag. The opening tag indicates the start of an element, while the closing tag denotes the end of the element. The content is the information or other elements nested within the opening and closing tags. For example:

```html
<p>This is an example of an HTML element.</p>
```

In the above example, `<p>` is the opening tag, `This is an example of an HTML element.` is the content, and `</p>` is the closing tag. Together, they form the `<p>` element.

HTML tags define the type and purpose of an element, while HTML elements include the tags along with the content they wrap. Tags are used to create elements, and elements represent the complete unit within an HTML document.

It's important to use HTML tags correctly and ensure that they are properly opened and closed to maintain the proper structure and semantics of the document.
