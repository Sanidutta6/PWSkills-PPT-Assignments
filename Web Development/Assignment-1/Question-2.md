Semantic tags in HTML are elements that carry meaning and convey the structural and semantic information of the content they wrap. These tags provide a way to describe the purpose and significance of the content within the document.

Some commonly used semantic tags in HTML5 include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<figure>`, and `<figcaption>`, among others.

Here are a few reasons why semantic tags are important and why we need them:

1. **Accessibility:** Semantic tags improve the accessibility of web content for users of assistive technologies, such as screen readers. These technologies rely on the semantic structure of the HTML document to properly understand and navigate the content.

2. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Semantic tags can have a positive impact on search engine rankings. Search engines utilize the semantic structure of the page to better understand the content and its relevance to search queries.

3. **Code Readability and Maintenance:** Semantic tags make the HTML code more readable and maintainable. By using tags that accurately describe the content, it becomes easier for developers to understand the structure and purpose of the elements when working on the codebase.

4. **Future Compatibility and Standardization:** Semantic tags are designed to have consistent meanings and behaviors across different browsers and devices. By using semantic tags, you align your code with web standards and ensure compatibility with future technologies and updates.

5. **Separation of Concerns:** Semantic tags separate the structure and presentation of a web page. They provide a clear separation between the content and the styling applied through CSS, promoting better maintainability and reusability of the code.

Using semantic tags is not mandatory, and you can still create a functional web page using non-semantic elements like `<div>` and `<span>`. However, employing semantic tags improves the quality, accessibility, and maintainability of your HTML code, while also conveying the intended meaning and structure of the content.

By choosing appropriate semantic tags based on the purpose of your content, you enhance the user experience, improve search engine optimization, and contribute to the overall quality of the web.
