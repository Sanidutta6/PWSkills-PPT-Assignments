`<!DOCTYPE html>` is not an HTML tag. It is called a Document Type Declaration (DTD) or Document Type Definition.

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is placed at the beginning of an HTML document to specify the version of HTML being used and the rules that the markup of the document must adhere to. It informs the web browser about the type of HTML being used and helps the browser render the document correctly.

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is used for HTML5 documents, which is the latest version of HTML. It informs the browser to interpret the document as HTML5, enabling the use of modern HTML features and ensuring that the document is rendered correctly.

The declaration itself does not have an end tag and does not contain any attributes or content. It is a standalone instruction that helps the browser determine the document type and rendering mode.

Including the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is considered good practice and is typically included at the beginning of every HTML5 document to ensure compatibility with modern web standards and proper rendering across different browsers.
