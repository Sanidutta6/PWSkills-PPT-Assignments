The `<figure>` tag and `<img>` tag serve different purposes in HTML. Here's a breakdown of the differences between the two:

**<img> tag:**

The `<img>` tag is specifically used to insert an image into an HTML document. It does not have a closing tag and is considered an empty or void element. The `<img>` tag requires the `src` attribute, which specifies the URL or path to the image file. It is primarily used to display static images on a web page.

Example:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
```

In the above example, the `<img>` tag is used to display an image with the specified source (`src`) and alternative text (`alt`). The `alt` attribute provides alternative descriptive text for the image, which is helpful for accessibility and in case the image cannot be loaded.

**<figure> tag:**

The `<figure>` tag is used to encapsulate and group together self-contained content, typically for media such as images, videos, illustrations, diagrams, etc. It is a semantic tag that helps provide additional context and structure to the content it wraps. Unlike the `<img>` tag, the `<figure>` tag requires a closing tag.

Example:
```html
<figure>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
  <figcaption>Caption or description for the image</figcaption>
</figure>
```

In the above example, the `<figure>` tag is used to wrap the `<img>` tag representing the image. The `<figcaption>` tag is used as a child of the `<figure>` tag to provide a caption or description for the image. The `<figcaption>` tag is optional but recommended to provide additional context for the content within the `<figure>` element.

The `<figure>` tag is useful when you want to associate a caption or description with an image or other media content. It helps convey the relationship between the media and its accompanying text.

To summarize, the `<img>` tag is specifically for inserting images, while the `<figure>` tag is used to group media content, such as images, along with optional captions or descriptions.
