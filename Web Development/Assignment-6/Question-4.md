OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It is a way of structuring and designing software that focuses on creating reusable, modular, and maintainable code by emphasizing the concepts of objects, classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

Here are the key concepts of OOPS:

1. Objects: Objects are the fundamental building blocks of OOPS. An object represents a real-world entity or concept and encapsulates its state (data) and behavior (methods/functions). Objects are created from classes.

2. Classes: Classes are blueprints or templates for creating objects. They define the properties (data) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. Classes serve as a blueprint to create multiple instances of objects with similar characteristics.

3. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes. It promotes code reuse and supports the concept of hierarchy. Subclasses (child classes) inherit the characteristics of the parent class, enabling the sharing of common attributes and behaviors while allowing customization.

4. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods together within a class, where the internal workings and data of an object are hidden from the outside world. It provides data protection and allows controlled access through public and private interfaces.

5. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. It provides a way to perform a single action in different ways based on the specific object's type or class. Polymorphism enables code to be written in a more generic and flexible manner.
