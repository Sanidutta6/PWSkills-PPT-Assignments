In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects with similar properties and behaviors. It is a syntactical construct introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) that provides a more structured and intuitive way to implement object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

Here are the key aspects of classes in JavaScript:

**1. Class Declaration:** A class is declared using the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class. For example:
```javascript
class MyClass {
  // class members (properties and methods)
}
```

**2. Constructors:** A constructor is a special method within a class that is called when a new object is created using the `new` keyword. It is used to initialize the object's properties and perform any setup needed. The constructor method is defined using the `constructor` keyword. For example:
```javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    // constructor code
  }
}
```

**3. Properties:** Class properties are variables associated with objects created from the class. They define the state or characteristics of the objects. Properties are defined inside the class but outside of any methods. For example:
```javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    this.propertyName = value;
  }
}
```

**4. Methods:** Methods are functions defined within a class that define the behavior or actions of the objects created from the class. They are defined inside the class and can access the object's properties using the `this` keyword. For example:
```javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    // constructor code
  }

  myMethod() {
    // method code
  }
}
```

**5. Inheritance:** Classes in JavaScript can be used to implement inheritance, where one class inherits properties and methods from another class. This is achieved using the `extends` keyword. The derived class (child class) inherits the characteristics of the base class (parent class), and it can add or override methods and properties as needed. For example:
```javascript
class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
  // additional methods and properties
}
```

**6. Objects Instantiation:** Objects are created from a class using the `new` keyword followed by the class name and any required constructor arguments. For example:
```javascript
const myObject = new MyClass();
```
