The differences between `inline`, `inline-block`, and `block` are related to how elements are displayed and how they interact with other elements within the document flow.

Here's a breakdown of the differences:

1. **Inline Elements (`display: inline`):**
   - Inline elements do not start on a new line and only occupy the necessary width and height to contain their content.
   - They flow within the surrounding text or other inline elements.
   - They ignore the `width` and `height` properties, and margin and padding on the top and bottom have no effect.
   - Examples of inline elements are `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, etc.

2. **Block Elements (`display: block`):**
   - Block elements start on a new line and occupy the full available width of their parent container by default.
   - They create a block-level box and force subsequent elements to start on a new line.
   - They respect the `width`, `height`, margin, padding, and other box-model properties.
   - Examples of block elements are `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, etc.

3. **Inline-Block Elements (`display: inline-block`):**
   - Inline-block elements share characteristics of both inline and block elements.
   - They flow within the surrounding text like inline elements but can have a defined width, height, margin, padding, etc., similar to block elements.
   - They do not force subsequent elements to start on a new line but can exist on the same line with other inline or inline-block elements.
   - Examples of inline-block elements are `<img>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, etc.

In summary, `inline` elements flow within the text and only occupy the necessary space, while `block` elements start on a new line and occupy the full width available. `inline-block` elements combine aspects of both, allowing for inline flow while also allowing for explicit width, height, and other box-model properties.
