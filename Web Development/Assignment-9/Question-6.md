React fragments are a feature in React that allow you to group multiple elements together without adding an extra DOM element to the rendered output. Fragments act as a wrapper for a collection of elements, providing a way to return multiple elements from a component's render method without introducing unnecessary elements in the DOM tree.

Here's an example of using React fragments:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Heading 1</h1>
      <p>Paragraph 1</p>
      <p>Paragraph 2</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

In the above example, the fragment is represented by the empty angle brackets `<>...</>`. Within the fragment, you can include multiple elements, such as headings, paragraphs, or any other valid JSX elements.

Here's why you should use React fragments:

1. Grouping Elements: Fragments allow you to group multiple elements together without the need for a wrapper element. This can be useful when you need to return adjacent elements from a component's render method. Instead of using a parent container element like `<div>`, you can use a fragment to avoid adding unnecessary elements to the DOM tree.

2. Clean DOM Structure: By using fragments, you can keep your rendered output cleaner and more semantically meaningful. Instead of introducing extra wrapper elements that may not serve any purpose other than grouping, fragments allow you to keep the DOM structure concise and focused on the actual content.

3. Avoiding CSS Interference: In some cases, adding a wrapper element around a group of elements can interfere with CSS styles or layout calculations. Fragments help prevent such interference by removing the need for an additional DOM element.

4. Mapping Lists: When rendering a list of elements using `map`, fragments can be used to wrap each individual item, ensuring proper grouping without introducing extra container elements.

5. Performance Optimization: Since fragments don't add extra elements to the DOM tree, they can improve performance by reducing the size and complexity of the rendered output. This can be particularly beneficial when working with large lists or rendering deeply nested components.
