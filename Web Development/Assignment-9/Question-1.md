In React, hooks are functions that allow you to use state, lifecycle methods, and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to write reusable and stateful logic without the need for class components. Hooks provide a simpler and more intuitive way to work with React's features in functional components.

Hooks can be identified by the naming convention that starts with the prefix "use" followed by a descriptive name. Some of the commonly used hooks in React are:

1. useState: It allows functional components to have state. The useState hook returns a state variable and a function to update that state. For example:

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

2. useEffect: It replaces lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount. The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components. For example:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Code to run after every render
  // and perform cleanup before the next render
}, [dependencies]);
```

3. useContext: It enables functional components to consume values from the nearest context. The useContext hook allows you to access context values without the need for nested consumers. For example:

```jsx
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```

4. useRef: It provides a way to hold a mutable value that persists across renders. The useRef hook returns a mutable ref object that can hold any value. For example:

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef(null);
```

5. useMemo: It allows for memoization of expensive computations, preventing unnecessary recalculations. The useMemo hook returns a memoized value that only changes when the dependencies change. For example:

```jsx
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

6. useCallback: It memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-creation of functions in child components. The useCallback hook returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes when the dependencies change. For example:

```jsx
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  // Handle click event
}, [dependencies]);
```
