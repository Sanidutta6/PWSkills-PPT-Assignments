In React, component lifecycle refers to the various stages a component goes through from its creation to its eventual removal from the DOM. Each stage in the lifecycle provides specific hooks or methods that allow developers to perform actions at different points in a component's existence. 

The React component lifecycle can be divided into three main phases:

1. **Mounting Phase:**
   - `constructor()`: This is the first method called when a component is created. It is used for initializing state and binding event handlers.
   - `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`: This static method is called before rendering and allows the component to update its state based on changes in props.
   - `render()`: This method is responsible for rendering the component's UI and returning JSX.
   - `componentDidMount()`: This method is called immediately after the component is mounted (i.e., inserted into the DOM). It is often used to fetch data from an API, set up subscriptions, or perform other initialization tasks.

2. **Updating Phase:**
   - `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`: Similar to the mounting phase, this method is called before rendering during the updating phase. It allows the component to update its state based on changes in props.
   - `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`: This method determines if the component should re-render by comparing the current props and state with the next props and state. It is commonly used for performance optimization.
   - `render()`: This method re-renders the component's UI based on the updated props or state.
   - `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`: This method is called right before the changes from the virtual DOM are reflected in the actual DOM. It allows the component to capture information from the DOM before it potentially gets changed.
   - `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`: This method is called after the component has been updated and re-rendered. It is typically used for side effects, such as making additional API calls or updating the DOM based on changes.

3. **Unmounting Phase:**
   - `componentWillUnmount()`: This method is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM. It is used to perform cleanup tasks like canceling timers, unsubscribing from event listeners, or disposing of resources.
