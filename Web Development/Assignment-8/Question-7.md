Prop drilling in React refers to the process of passing props through multiple intermediate components that do not need the props themselves. It occurs when a component needs to pass data to a deeply nested child component, but the data has to be passed through several intermediate components in the component tree.

Here's an example to illustrate prop drilling:

```jsx
function ParentComponent() {
  const data = "Hello, Prop Drilling!";

  return (
    <div>
      <IntermediateComponent data={data} />
    </div>
  );
}

function IntermediateComponent({ data }) {
  return <ChildComponent data={data} />;
}

function ChildComponent({ data }) {
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

In the above example, the `ParentComponent` needs to pass the `data` prop to the `ChildComponent`. However, the `IntermediateComponent` acts as an intermediary and has no use for the `data` prop. The prop has to be drilled through the intermediate component to reach the desired child component.

Prop drilling can lead to several issues:
1. It makes the codebase less maintainable and harder to understand as the number of intermediate components increases.
2. It can introduce unnecessary complexity and boilerplate code.
3. Changes in the structure of the component tree can require modifications to multiple intermediate components.

To avoid prop drilling and improve code maintainability, there are a few strategies you can employ:

1. Use React Context: React Context provides a way to share data between components without passing props explicitly through every intermediate component. Context allows you to define a "provider" component at a higher level in the component tree and have nested components consume the data using "consumers" or the `useContext` hook.

2. Lift State Up: If the data that needs to be shared is related to the application's state, consider lifting the state up to a common ancestor component. By keeping the shared state in a higher-level component, you can pass it down to the required child components without prop drilling.

3. Component Composition: Instead of passing data through multiple intermediate components, consider restructuring your component tree to compose smaller, more focused components. This way, you can ensure that only the necessary data is passed directly to the components that need it, reducing the need for prop drilling.

4. Custom Hooks: Create custom hooks to encapsulate and manage shared state or data. Custom hooks can be reused across components, providing an efficient way to share data without prop drilling.

By using these techniques, you can minimize prop drilling and improve the overall organization, maintainability, and readability of your React codebase.
