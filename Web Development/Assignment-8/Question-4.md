In the context of React, a component is a self-contained, reusable piece of code that encapsulates a specific part of a user interface. It represents a modular building block for creating UI elements and functionality in React applications. Components enable developers to break down complex UIs into smaller, manageable parts and promote reusability across different parts of an application.

In React, there are two main types of components:

1. Function Components (also known as Stateless Components):
Function components are JavaScript functions that accept props (short for properties) as input and return JSX (JavaScript XML) to define the component's UI. They are primarily used for presenting UI elements based on the input props and have no internal state of their own. Function components are simpler and easier to write and test.

Example of a function component:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

2. Class Components (also known as Stateful Components):
Class components are JavaScript classes that extend the `React.Component` class. They have more advanced features and capabilities compared to function components, such as managing internal state and lifecycle methods. Class components are suitable for components that need to maintain and manage their own state or require more complex logic.

Example of a class component:

```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  increment() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.increment()}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
